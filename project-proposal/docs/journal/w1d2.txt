Today I worked on the NotesIndex component, which displays
the list of the current_user's notes.
I had issues this morning with Heroku, and then issues with using
Postgres on my Ubuntu machine. The Heroku issue was resovled by moving
all files for my application under one folder. I resolved the Postgres
issue later by changing the password for the postgres user.
