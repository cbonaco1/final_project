Today I got the details of a note to display when the user clicks
on a note from the list.
I had a bug in my Store where I was not actually returning the
note fetched from the store.

My next tasks include having the details for the first note from the list automatically
be displayed when the user goes to the list of notes.
I also need to implement the React auth we went over this afternoon.
