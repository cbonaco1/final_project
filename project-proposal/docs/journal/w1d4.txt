Today I mainly worked on React auth.
I referenced the demo done yesterday afternoon, and  was pleased with how it came out.
With auth working for signing in and signing out, I edited how the
error messages are displayed, since they are now React components.
To do this, I created a ErrorMessage component, and an ErrorStore.
When the login fails, this store is notified, which then tells the
component to display a message.

I need to work on creating a new user, and logging in under the guest
account. I made better seed data for the guest account. The seed data acts
like instructions for a new user.
