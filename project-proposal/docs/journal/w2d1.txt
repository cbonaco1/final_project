Today I added font-awesome to my project in order to use the widgets
on the sidebar component. The icons available were not exact matches
of Evernote, but after an earlier issue, I was glad to be able to use the icons.
With the icons added, I implemented the NotebookIndex and NotebookIndexItem
components. These list all of the logged in user's Notebooks. When the user
clicks on the Notebook icon, a list of all their notebooks, along with the
number of notes for each notebook are displayed. Clicking on a Notebook
filters the NotesIndex to display just the Notes from the selected Notebook.
The user can then click on the Notes icon and display all notes, regardless of
Notebook.

In general, this works. The notes are displayed for each notebook, and the user
can click on any of the notes in the new list to display the Note details.
The areas I need to improve here are the NoteDetail component, and the order
in which the NoteIndexItems are displayed when the user filters them by
notebook. When the user clicks between Notebooks, the details of the first note
in each notebook is selected. When the user clicks on a Notebook with the
list of all Notes visible, the details of the first note are not displayed.
I think this is an issue in the store.

Today I also began implementing CRUD operations for Note objects, specifically
update. The CRUD operations for the Notes are facilitated through the text editor.
I imported the Quill JS library in order to accomplish this. There is a react-quil
library; however I felt the documentation for Quill JS was easier to follow. I
implemented the update operation on the Note body. I need to add the Note title
to the text of Quill editor so I can distinguish between Note title and body.

Tomorrow I want to finish CRUD operations for Notes, Notebooks, and start
working on Tags.
