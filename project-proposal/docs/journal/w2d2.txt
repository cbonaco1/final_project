This morning I resolved an issue I had where the details of the selected
NoteIndexItem were not being displayed when the item was clicked on. I had
to rearrange code in my render method of the NoteDetail component in order to
resolve this. The rest of the day I implemented the CRUD operations for Note objects.
Most of the CRUD operations for Notes are done using the text editor, which I used the
Quill JS library for. I ended up making the editor toolbar its own component,
since I needed it for both editing a note, and adding a new note.
For adding a new Note, I added an icon on the sidebar,
which brings up a modal window containing the new Note form on click. Overall
I was pleased with how this came out. For deleting a note, I added a garbage
bin icon to each note index item, which deletes the note on click.

I would like to do more thorough testing of these CRUD operations, but they
work in terms of impacting the database. In terms of the front-end, when I delete
a note, when the NoteIndex component is re-rendered, it still is looking
for the deleted note. I think this might have something to do with the store
not being updated.

Today we also did peer reviews of our applications. I reviewed a clone of
Medium, a blogging forum. I really liked the design of the site, but had
some difficulty figuring out how to do certain things. I am not familiar with
Medium so maybe I wasn't the best candidate to review the site; however
it did seem like a lot of work went into it.

Tomorrow I want to work on CRUD operations for Notebooks. I want to implement
a modal window for the list of notebooks, similar to how Evernote displays
the notebooks. After doing a modal today, I feel comfortable with this. I also
need to work on file upload, search, and Omni Auth.
