Last full day of working on final projects.

This morning I worked on resolving a bug I had with deleting a notebook.
When deleting a notebook, the notes associated with that notebook also
need to be deleted. After a notebook was deleted, selecting a note from
the list of remaining notes produced an error that the note was undefined.
After consulting with two TAs, we figured out that it was due to my
jbuilder notebook index view not rendering enough information. In the notebook
index view, I was returning the note associated with that notebook, but I needed
to render the note partial.

After that I implemented authentication with Facebook. Implementing the login
was pretty straight forward; however I needed to create a default notebook
and welcome note for a user logging in for the first time with Facebook. For
users creating a new account (not with Facebook), I do this in Javascript in
a callback to the api util function creating a new user. In the case of
Facebook, I needed to create this notebook and note in the controller.

With that implemented, I added some more styling, and a stock photo
for the landing welcome page. I was pleased with how this came out.

Overall I am pleased with how my app came out up to this point. I would like to
add some more styling to it tomorrow, and finalize my seed data.
