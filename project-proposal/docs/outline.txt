    -Challenge was updating the Notebooks dropdwon in the Toolbar component
      -The toolbar has a Notebook state, and listens to the NotebookStore
      -When a notebook is deleted, it re-renders itself.
      This is important since we dont want a user to add a note to a ntoebook
      that has been deleted.
